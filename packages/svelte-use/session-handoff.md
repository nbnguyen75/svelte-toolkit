# Session Handoff — svelte-use

## Current State

- Harness and tooling configured in `packages/svelte-use/` (see `progress.md`).
- `feat-001`, `feat-002`, `feat-003` are `done` (gates green 2026-10-01).
- Pure library package (no SvelteKit shell). Shipped utils:
  `useScrollToTop`, `useEventListener`, `useDark`, `useClipboard` (browser) and
  `useStorage`/`useLocalStorage`/`useSessionStorage` (state), plus shared
  `is.ts` / `getter.ts`. Barrel exports 9 symbols.
- `feature_list.json` work queue: `cut`/`deferred`/`svelte-native` entries encode
  scope decisions (see `scope.md`, `docs/recipes.md`).

## Immediate Next Task

- feat-004 (Timing foundations) is the next unblocked batch — `useDebounceFn`,
  `useThrottleFn`, `useInterval`, etc. from `sv-utils/packages/src/lib/utilities/`.
  Then feat-005, which blocks feat-006/007.

## Harness Notes (learned this session — do not rediscover)

- Svelte's `Tween` reads `performance.now()` internally, so `test/fixtures/raf.ts`
  cannot drive it. Use `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()`.
- `typescript/no-unsafe-type-assertion` is set to `error` with no options, and
  `unknown as T` is rejected for _any_ generic target. A typed deserializer
  therefore cannot cast its way out — `.agents/rules/typescript.md` prescribes
  a runtime type guard instead, which is how `useStorage`'s serializer is built.
- `$effect` cleanup must be callable, not `undefined`: a bare early `return;`
  trips `consistent-return`. Return a no-op function instead.
- In the `node` test environment `svelte` resolves to its **server** build: runes
  are inert and `$effect.root` never calls back. SSR probes must call the factory
  directly, never inside an effect root or `mount()`.

## How to Resume

1. Read `packages/svelte-use/AGENTS.md` and `packages/svelte-use/.agents/rules/`.
2. Run `.\init.ps1` to ensure all gates pass.
3. Check `feature_list.json` for the next unfinished utility.

## Blockers

- None — baseline verification not run yet in this repo.

## Files

- `packages/svelte-use/AGENTS.md` — canonical harness.
- `packages/svelte-use/feature_list.json` — roadmap and work queue.
- `packages/svelte-use/progress.md` — session log.

## Next Session

- **Last Updated**: 2026-10-01
- **Current Objective**: baseline verification, then first utility port.
- **Recommended Next Step**: run `.\init.ps1` (or `./init.sh`) from `packages/svelte-use/`.
